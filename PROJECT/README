Quick note on folder names:
      conv       :  convergence tests on pw energy and kpoint grids
      codes      :  various scripts I used during the project
      deut       :  relaxations using deuterium instead of hydrogen
      exp        :  experimental data for overlaying on the raman spectra
      fine	 :  relaxations with a finer difference between pressures
      raman_[N]	 :  raman calculations done at [N] GPa	  
      relax    	 :  standard relaxations
      r[N]     	 :  subsequent relaxations at higher pw cutoff/kpoints
      Results	 :  a results folder I shared with you earlier in the project
